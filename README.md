# Data Visualisation Module Project using D3.js
## I decided to show some visualizations about formula 1.
### The map plot <a href="https://brendansd3.github.io/D3/mapplot.html">Can be found here</a> shows the locations of all the races in the 2018 season, if you click on one of the orange circles you will get the top 3 for that race 
## the other pages shows bar charts of the number of constructor wins and driver wins for a range of years 
### I was new to d3 and javascript and data visualisation at the time so it is far from perfect but cool to play around with
